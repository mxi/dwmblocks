dwmblocks - a status monitor for dwm
------------------------------------
The upstream implementation of dwmblocks which this repository is based
on can be found at https://github.com/ashish-yadav11/dwmblocks.


Installation
------------
If dwm IS already patched with dwm-systray, then apply

	dwm-systray-dwmblocks-6.2.diff

to remove it AND apply this dwmblocks patch over it.

Alternatively, if you DO NOT have dwm-systray patched, you can apply

	dwm-dwmblocks-6.2.diff

to get it immediately.


Scripts
-------
My personal scripts used to update and respond to clicks on these blocks
